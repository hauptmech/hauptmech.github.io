title: OpenCV for Android 2.4.11, gradle-experimental, and Android Studio 1.4.1
---

The last few days I have been trying to get up to speed on ROS and OpenCV in the context
of Android. I have to say that it's been really frustrating. There has been a big
transition in the Android world from Eclipse+Ant to Intellij+Gradle. Documentation has
not been kept up, and downstream OpenCV has not followed the transition, in code or documentation. ROS Android is even further behind. It all adds up to a mess for someone like
me who is new to java and Android. 

Anyway, here's my recipe for getting the OpenCV Android samples to work with Gradle, Android Studio 1.4.1, the Android NDK, and the gradle-experimental plugin. I don't pretend to understand all of it and I have no idea if it's best practice, but it seems to work. 

1. Android studio should be installed.
2. The Android NDK should be installed via the Android SDK Manager
3. The OpenCV Android SDK should be downloaded and unzipped

I've done the recipe as a bash script because I like being able to cut and paste. You can cut and paste each code section into a bash shell and it should do the right thing...

First set the location of the root directory of the OpenCV SDK.

```bash
export OPENCV_SDK=/home/teh/wip/ocv24
```

Your build tools version needs to be set correctly. Here's an easy way
to see what you have installed. (You can install other versions via the 
Android SDK Manager).

```bash
echo "Your buildToolsVersion is one of: "
ls $ANDROID_HOME/build-tools
```
Create your gradle build files...

```bash
cat > $OPENCV_SDK/sdk/java/build.gradle <<'==='
apply plugin: 'com.android.model.library'
model {
    android {
        compileSdkVersion = 23
        buildToolsVersion = "23.0.2"

        defaultConfig.with {
            minSdkVersion.apiLevel = 8
            targetSdkVersion.apiLevel = 23
        }
    }

    android.buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled = false
        }
        debug{
            minifyEnabled = false
        }
    }
   android.sources {
       main.manifest { source { srcDirs = [ "."] } } 
       main.res { source { srcDirs = [ "res"] } } 
       main.aidl { source { srcDirs = [ "src"] } } 
       main.java { source { srcDirs = [ "src"] } } 
   }
 
}

TUT1=$OPENCV_SDK/samples/tutorial-1-camerapreview

cat > $TUT1/settings.gradle <<'==='
include ':openCVLibrary2411'
project(':openCVLibrary2411').projectDir = new File('../../sdk/java')

cat > $TUT1/build.gradle <<'==='
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle-experimental:0.2.1'
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}

apply plugin: 'com.android.model.application'

model {
    android {
        compileSdkVersion = 23
        buildToolsVersion = "23.0.2"

        defaultConfig.with {
            applicationId = "org.opencv.samples.tutorial1"
            minSdkVersion.apiLevel = 8
            targetSdkVersion.apiLevel = 23
        }
    }

    android.sources {
       main.manifest { source { srcDirs = [ "."] } }
       main.res { source { srcDirs = [ "res"] } }   
       //main.aidl { source { srcDirs = [ "res"] } }   
       main.java { source { srcDirs = [ "src"] } }
    } 

    android.buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled = false
            proguardFiles += file('proguard-rules.pro')
        }
        debug {
             minifyEnabled = false
        }
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile project(':openCVLibrary2411')
}

```
Finally, set up the correct gradle wrapper. Gradle needs a clean directory
to do this.

```bash
cd $TUT1
mkdir tmp; cd tmp
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 2.5
mv gradle* ..
cd ..; rm -rf tmp

```

You should now be all set. Build the tutoral with the following command:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

It should build your apk, putting it in ./build/outputs/apk

You can now browse to this directory with Android Studio and open up the 
project.
