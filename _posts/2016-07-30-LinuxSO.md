title: Linux LD_LIBRARY_PATH, rpath, and ld.so.conf (in that order)
---

I see a lot of people make life a lot more complicated for themselves than they need to
because they don't really understand how dynamically linked libraries work.

Let's assume for the moment that you understand the pros/cons of static vs dynamic linking and a shared library is appropriate.

How do you make sure your program is using the correct library of the correct version?

In short: `man ld.so`

You can inspect which libraries a program is loading with `readelf`

```
readelf -d $PROGRAM
```

The linker will search in the following order:

1. `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable
2. rpath (`man ld` search "-rpath")
3. `/etc/ld.so.conf` (`ldconfig` to update)
